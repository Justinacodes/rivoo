# Project Requirements Document: Aura - The Emergency Response Network

## 1. Introduction
Aura is a responsive web application designed to dramatically reduce emergency response times and improve patient outcomes. It connects individuals in distress with the nearest, best-equipped medical facilities in real-time. The system consists of two primary interfaces: a User/Samaritan portal for reporting emergencies and a Hospital portal for managing incoming alerts.

| FR-001                    | User Onboarding & Medical Profile   | As a new user, I want to create an account and pre-fill my critical medical information, so that first responders have it instantly during an emergency.          | User can sign up/log in. User can access a profile page to enter/edit blood type, allergies, chronic conditions, and emergency contacts.                                            | MUS    |
| FR-002                    | Single-Click Emergency Alert        | As a user in distress, I want to press a single, prominent button to instantly send an alert with my location and medical profile to nearby hospitals.            | A large "SOS" button on the main screen, when clicked, sends user's profile data and current geolocation to the backend for processing.                                             | MUS    |
| FR-003                    | Report for Others (Samaritan Mode)  | As a bystander (Samaritan), I want to report an emergency for someone else, describing the situation, so that help can be dispatched correctly.                   | User can select "Report for Someone Else," which opens a simple form to input observations (e.g., "car accident," "unconscious"). This report is linked to the Samaritan's account. | MUS    |

| FR-005                    | Voice-to-Text Incident Reporting    | As a Samaritan in a chaotic situation, I want to speak into my phone to describe the incident, so I can provide details quickly and hands-free.                   | A microphone icon allows the user to record a short voice note. The system transcribes the audio to text and attaches it to the emergency alert.                                    | Future |
| FR-006                    | Transfer Case to Victim             | As a Samaritan, I want to transfer the official case record to the victim once they are stable, so their own account can manage the follow-up.                    | A feature to link an incident created by a Samaritan to a victim's Aura account via QR code or phone number.                                                                        | Future |

| FR-007                    | Secure Hospital Login               | As a hospital staff member, I need to log in securely to access the emergency dashboard.                                                                          | A standard, role-based login system for registered hospital personnel.                                                                                                              | MUS    |
| FR-008                    | Real-Time Alert Dashboard           | As a hospital staff member, I want to see a live dashboard of new emergency alerts in our vicinity, prioritized by urgency and proximity.                         | A dashboard view that lists incoming alerts. Each alert shows the incident type, distance, and a summary of the patient's condition (if available).                                 | MUS    |
| FR-009                    | Accept/Acknowledge Alert            | As a hospital staff member, I want to "accept" an alert, so the system knows we are responding and can inform the user.                                           | A button on each alert allows the hospital to claim the case.

| FR-011                    | Manage Hospital Availability        | As a hospital administrator, I want to update our hospital's status (e.g., bed capacity, specialist on-duty), so the AI dispatcher makes more accurate decisions. | An admin panel where staff can toggle services on/off or update key metrics like "ER Beds Available: 2".                                                                            | Future |

| FR-014                    | AI Dispatch Logic (Resource-Based)  | As the system, I want to use hospital-provided availability data (FR-011) to make smarter dispatch decisions.                                                     | The dispatch algorithm will weigh proximity, bed availability, and specialist status to select the optimal hospital, not just the closest one.                                      | Future |
